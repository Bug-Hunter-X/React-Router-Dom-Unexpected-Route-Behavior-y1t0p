# React Router Dom Unexpected Route Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router Dom: unexpected route behavior.  Routes may fail to render components correctly, or links might not navigate as anticipated. This often stems from incorrect path configurations, missing or mismatched Route elements, or problems with nested routes. The issue is resolved by carefully examining path definitions, ensuring all routes are properly nested and that components are correctly associated with their paths. The solution focuses on identifying and correcting the most frequent causes of this type of unexpected behavior in React Router Dom.
